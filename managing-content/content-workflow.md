# Content Workflow

During the process of creating or editing content, you can save your progress by clicking the blue "Save" button located at the top of the page. If any required fields are left incomplete, saving will not proceed until all the necessary information is provided. Once successfully saved, the changes will immediately take effect on the front end.

By default, content possesses two statuses: "Published" and "Unpublished." Published content is visible to users, while unpublished content remains hidden. This feature proves useful when you want to conceal content that is no longer needed or when working on an unfinished draft.

If you wish to delete a piece of content, access the editing interface and click on the "Delete" link located in the sidebar (pictured below). Please note that deleted content is irretrievable, so exercise caution when using this option, as it should generally be avoided.
