# URL Path Settings

By default, a URL path is automatically generated for your content item based on its title. To view the auto-generated URL, expand the URL Path Settings. If you wish to override the generated URL, simply uncheck the checkbox labeled "Generate automatic URL alias" and enter your desired custom value in the "URL alias" field.
