# Managing Content

The new site's pages are constructed using the innovative 'Component Based Design' methodology. This approach empowers editors to effortlessly create dynamic pages, where content can be rearranged and updated with greater ease.

To provide you with utmost customization and real-time preview capabilities, the site incorporates the remarkable Layout Builder. This powerful tool enables you to arrange content on a page effortlessly through intuitive drag and drop functionality. Our UX and development team have meticulously defined various sections and components (blocks) that can be combined to create virtually any type of page layout, making the usage of Layout Builder a breeze.

You have the freedom to infuse life into your page by adding content or 'Components.' This section will guide you through the process.
