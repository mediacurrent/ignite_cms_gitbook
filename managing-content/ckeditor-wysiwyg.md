# CKEditor WYSIWYG

Many text fields you will use contain a WYSIWYG or “What You See Is What You Get” type of editor. This is an HTML text editor that provides many editing functions such as styling text, adding links, and embedding images. The CKEditor box is used on various fields across the site to provide the editor the ability to provide rich content.

You can also use the CKEditor to apply heading structures. To do this, highlight the text you want to make a heading, and click the ‘Format’ drop down and choose your heading level. Other formatting to apply in the CKEditor includes bold, italics, strikethroughs, superscript/subscript, and either ordered (numbered) lists or unordered (bulleted) lists.
