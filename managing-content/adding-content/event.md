# Event

Within Ignite, the event content type introduces additional fields to the core set of fields found across all content types.

The first notable addition is the "Dates" field, located in the Basic field section, allowing the author to specify the start and end dates of an event.

The second field is an optional link field, providing the option to include further details about the event. Frequently, Drupal events are associated with external calendars or third-party event systems, making this link field particularly useful.
