# Adding Content

The Ignite install profile comes with a set of preconfigured content types that can be used to create new pages on a website. Each content type follows a consistent pattern, which makes it easy for both editors and developers to use.

Here are the content types that are included in the Ignite install profile:

* Article: This content type is used to create articles, such as blog posts or news articles.&#x20;
* Basic page: This content type is used to create basic pages, such as landing pages or contact pages.&#x20;
* Event: This content type is used to create events, such as conferences or workshops.&#x20;
* Layout page: This content type is used to create pages with a custom layout.&#x20;
* Press release: This content type is used to create press releases.&#x20;
* Profile: This content type is used to create profiles of people or organizations.&#x20;
* Resource: This content type is used to create resources, such as documents, images, or videos. All of the content types in the Ignite install profile are optional and can be customized to meet the specific needs of a website.
